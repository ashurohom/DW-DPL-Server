group = store department : adding a “Store Department” group is the right way to control access to this “Manufacture or Purchase” action in Odoo.

We’ll create:

✅ A user group called “Store Department”

✅ Access rights so only members of that group can use the wizard

✅ Optional: Add it as a visible group in Settings → Users → Groups


  

product_vendor_rfq


group = rfq group : Users in the RFQ Department can manage RFQs and vendor quotes
